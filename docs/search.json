This era established the concept of “encoding model” in vision neuroscience and produced early natural-image reconstructions from fMRI.\nWhat they assume about cortex:\n\nVoxels behave like small receptive fields over the visual field.\nHigher areas can be modeled with semantic feature weights (e.g. “is there a face?”).\nThe mapping is linear and interpretable.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nSets up the whole evaluation paradigm: if we can predict the voxel from the stimulus, we “understand” that voxel.\nGives us pRF mapping in V1/V2/V3 and semantic maps in higher ventral stream.\n\nRepresentative work:\n\nEarly voxel-wise encoding models and pRF modeling from Gallant lab and related work in the late 2000s–early 2010s showing natural image identification from brain activity and mapping visual field positions in cortex.\n\nTag for posts: gen0-handcrafted, pRF, semantic-features"

    "text": "🧲 Gen3. Transformer Brain Encoders (2023 → 2025)\nThis is where the field stops thinking “a voxel is a passive receiver” and starts thinking “a cortical area is an active querying agent.”\nWe can break Gen3 into two key milestones.\n\nGen3A (2023): Transformers as the Readout\nCore idea: Instead of fitting one regressor per voxel, train a transformer to map visual tokens → brain responses under natural viewing. The model learns global correspondences between vision embeddings and cortical activity. This shows “brain prediction = sequence modeling / attention,” not just voxel-wise ridge.\nRepresentative work:\n\nAdeli, Sun & Kriegeskorte (2023), often described in the Algonauts Challenge 2023 context as “Predicting brain activity using Transformers.” They take frozen self-supervised ViT-style features (e.g. DINOv2-like encoders) and learn a transformer module to directly predict fMRI responses for natural scenes.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nFirst serious “the readout itself is a transformer.”\nStarts generalizing beyond early visual cortex.\n\nTag: gen3-transformer-proto, algonauts2023, image-to-fMRI\n\n\n\nGen3B (2025): ROI-Query Cortical Routing\nCore idea: Each cortical region of interest (ROI) is turned into its own learned query token. During inference:\n\nROI query token attends to visual tokens\nCross-attention pulls only the relevant visual information for that ROI\nThat becomes the predicted activity pattern for that region\n\nThis is explicitly pitched as solving high-level, category-selective cortex (faces, scenes, bodies etc.) with:\n\nbetter accuracy,\nfewer parameters,\nbuilt-in interpretability through attention routing.\n\nRepresentative work:\n\nAdeli, Sun & Kriegeskorte (2025), Transformer brain encoders explain human high-level visual responses, arXiv:2505.17329 (May 22, 2025). Claims:\n\nOutperforms classic deep-linear encoders and fwRF-style models, especially in high-level visual cortex.\nGives explicit “who-listened-to-what” maps via attention, which is way more neuroscientifically meaningful than post-hoc saliency.\nUses fewer parameters than fitting one regressor per voxel.\n\n\nTag: gen3-transformer-roi, cortical-routing, high-level-cortex\nThis is the inflection point I care about most."

    "text": "🎥 Gen4. Generative Brain Decoders (2023 → 2025)\nEverything above is encoding (stimulus → brain). Gen4 is decoding (brain → stimulus). This is a different arc, but historically it explodes in parallel 2023–2025, and it’s now merging back into alignment work.\nCore idea: Map brain activity into some latent semantic/visual space (CLIP text/image embeddings, Stable Diffusion latent codes, video diffusion tokens), and then generate an output that looks like / describes what the subject saw. So instead of “can I predict your voxel responses from the image,” it’s “can I guess the image from your voxel responses.”\n\nGen4A. Brain → Image via Diffusion\n\nTakagi & Nishimoto (2023), CVPR 2023: map fMRI to Stable Diffusion latent space and reconstruct high-resolution images a subject viewed. This was one of the first convincing “this is roughly what you saw” demos and got a lot of public attention.\nMindEye2 (2024): improves practicality by creating shared-subject models so new subjects need ~1 hour of data instead of huge personalized training. Uses CLIP-like latent alignment + diffusion decoding. This is framed as making fMRI→image reconstruction more scalable.\n\n\n\nGen4B. Brain → Video via Video Diffusion\n\nNeuroClips (2024): splits decoding into a “semantic reconstructor” and a “perception reconstructor,” then drives a text-to-video diffusion model to generate multi-second clips with smoother temporal dynamics.\nNeuroSwift (2025): aims at subject efficiency + limited GPU cost, pushing toward “usable, near-real-time-ish” decoding pipelines.\n\nWhy Gen4 matters even for encoding work:\n\nIt proves the brain signal contains rich semantic and visual detail that can drive an actual generator.\nIt also closes the loop conceptually: Gen3 says “cortex is a set of queries that route content”; Gen4 says “that content can be turned back into pictures / video.”\n\nTag: gen4-brain-to-image, diffusion, fMRI-decoding, video-reconstruction"
